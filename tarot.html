		<h2><em>Hind Sight is 20/20: <br />Tarot Cards for Working Women in a Global Pandemic
		<br />a collaboration between xtine burrough and Allison Jauregi</em></h2>
	<p>
		<em>Hind Sight is 20/20: Tarot Cards for Working Women in a Global Pandemic</em> takes two forms. We created a complete deck of tarot cards developed during the COVID-19 pandemic with illustrations made by Allison Jauregui and fabricated by burrough. The playing cards are made on copper for its natural antimicrobial qualities with illustrative features in black matte vinyl. </p>
		<br />
		<p>The second form of <em>Hind Sight...</em> showcases twelve of the major arcana in etchings on large (16 by 24 inch) copper plates. These etchings were made via a technique that combines laser etching with sandblasting and polishing. In addition to these large plates, an etched and sandblasted edition was first developed as a pilot version of this project at approximately 3.75 by 5.75 inches.</p>
						
		<h2>Live Tarot Reading</h2>
<p>We invite participants to choose a card from the copper deck. Our expert tarot reader summarizes the meaning of each card for participants as we gather together to manifest an understanding of our possible futures. On October 19, 2021, David Scoroposki read these tarot cards for participants at NYUâ€™s Bobst Library during the opening week of the exhibition <em>Ceremonial Techne.</em>  </p>
