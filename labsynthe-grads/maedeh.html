    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p class="text_column">
	My art interrogates how my identity is shaped by my culture, time, family, and country. I am inspired by my status, which can put me at odds with myself as both an artist in contemporary North American society and an immigrant student in the twenty-first century. I am constructing my artistic identity by finding myself in a foreign culture whose values and traditions are different from my own. Such tensions and disruptions create new opportunities for creating my narrative imagery. These works explore the psychological and emotional aspects that surface in my process of displacement.  
	  </p>
    <p class="text_column">
A series of my poems and short writings, inspired by my experiences after leaving my country, create the platform upon which I use my art to narrate my situation after immigration. These poetic narratives reveal small events (such as trying new foods) and large events (such as pursuing a successful career) as I live my life in the U.S.A. Such events, in combination with hopes and dreams, sometimes push my literary character forward and sometimes stop her from taking actions.
	  </p>
    <p class="text_column">A collection of printmaking, paintings with projecting animation and video, animation, video art, handmade book with recorder, and a series of short poems are presented in this project. This journey includes good and bad events together, with the happiness and sadness associated with them. These are the experiences of many immigrants. Only the taste of reaching the goal reduces the burden of such journey. With my writings and illustrations that complement each other, I tried to convey this feeling to a society full of immigrants and introduce them to this kind of life. Before starting the journey, the immigrant is familiar with the difficulties of this process and what others have said and heard, and yet it becomes a dangerous journey. The inhabitants of the destination country are usually unaware of the suffering that an immigrant would face. I have portrayed the hardships of this journey in a surreal atmosphere. I take the viewers away from the real world to introduce them to immigration through my creative, poetic process. </p>

    <p class="parallax_description">&#8220;My work illustrates my embodied immigrant experiences. To narrate the content provided by my poems and writing, I combine traditional creative processes such as printmaking with new technologies. The process of creating a narrative for audiences outside my native country requires a commitment to creativity in terms of both the generation of an idea as well as the methods to communicate that story.&#8221; </p>
