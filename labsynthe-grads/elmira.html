	  <p class="tagline"><strong>Contemporary Farr(ah)</strong> is an MFA thesis exhibition of time-based
installations built with invisible ink, blacklight LEDs, acrylics, and computing technologies. It is the result of years-long experimentations with an unconventional technique to create physical animations. </p>

    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p class="text_column">
	 In these installations, the movement of drawings painted by invisible ink on transparent acrylics, becomes visible under flashes of blacklight LEDs as animations. Through these exploratory works I seek to find and establish new links of communications in ways that connect to individuals, including myself, that can create relief and offer new promises of hope in non-traditional ways.

    <p class="text_column">
	The word Farr(ah), which means &quot;glory,&quot; represents a mythological, mystical force in Zoroastrian and Persian mythology that we all own and share as humans (Sharifi). This force that is a spiritual gift from God, also help the kings to rule with justice and assist the forces of good or light to win over the darkness. In general, Farr(ah) is an active living force that help humans to grow. Farr(ah) could also be represented as light, the same way many nonphysical forms have been represented in many fantasies. As a Persian artist, the projects presented in this thesis embody my interdisciplinary practice as a representation of my Farr(ah) in its most tangible form. 
	  </p>
    <p class="text_column">My thesis project is a meditation on anxiety and mindfulness practices as explored through a series of physical manifestations combining cultural referencing and psychology enhanced by animation, sculptural construction, and technology. </p>
