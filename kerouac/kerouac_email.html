    xtine's hand-made response to the 50th anniversary of the publication of
    Jack Kerouac's <em>On The Road</em>. <em>Paradise Obscura</em> is a hybrid
    visual-literary arts event, happening March 12, 2007 from 2:30 - midnight.
    The first 50 shoppers will receive a free hand-made, letter press printed
    shopping bag. </font></font><br>

    <td valign="top"><p><em><font size="1" face="helvetica, arial"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paradise Obscura</font></font></em><font size="1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> is a visual manifestation of the voyeuristic theme
developed in Jack Kerouac's <em>On the
Road</em>. By usurping the visual identity of a shopping bag, <em>Paradise
Obscura</em> is an interventionist project that will take place in (North
Beach) San Francisco, at the intersection of Jack Kerouac's <em>On
The Road</em>, City Lights Bookstore (owned by Beat poet/writer Lawrence
Ferlinghetti) and the interpersonal acts of voyeurism as shoppers eye each other's
bags in the city.  The elements of Kerouac's seminal
	      text are returned to the city where it was born, but within a new context:
	      the shopping bag. One of Sal Paradise's tho</font><font size="1" face="helvetica, arial"></font><font size="1" face="helvetica, arial">ughts (Kerouac's protagonist
	      and <em>other</em> voice) while traveling in San Francisco is manipulated
	      by the construction of the shopping bag. On the outside of the bag,
	      half of the message, "I sat there with these two madmen" places words in the
	      hands of the consumer, as if labeled by Kerouac, himself. On the inside
	      of the bag, the message incriminates the consumer, "Nothing happened." This
	      text could be translated to, "I bought something new...nothing happened;" and
	      act as a challenge to beliefs and attitudes common to consumer culture. </font>      </p>
	  <p><font size="1" face="helvetica, arial"> Following the tradition of the
	        Situationists International, a spectacle is made of the viewing public
	        by the transformation of the meaning of everyday materials. The bags
	        are used in the act of what Guy Debord would call a detournment. This
	        interventionist project is most effective outside of the gallery walls,
	        as the bags are distributed to unassuming consumers--literally translating
	        the unknowing consumer into an art collector. The bags benefit from
	        the traditionally passive role of the consumer while luring onlookers
	        to a text that both celebrates Kerouac's work and indicts anyone seated
	        within close proximity. It is the familiarity with the visual language
	        of the shopping bags that enables the consumption of the subversive
	        message. </font></td>
