	  <font size="1"><em><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paradise
	  Obscura</font></em><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> is
	  a visual manifestation of the voyeuristic theme developed in Jack Kerouac's <em>On
	  the Road</em>. By usurping the visual identity of a shopping bag, <em>Paradise
	  Obscura</em> is an interventionist project that will take place in (North
	  Beach) San Francisco, at the intersection of Jack Kerouac's <em>On The Road</em>,
	  City Lights Bookstore (owned by Beat poet/writer Lawrence Ferlinghetti) and
	  the interpersonal acts of voyeurism as shoppers eye each other's bags in the
	  city. The elements of Kerouac's seminal text are returned to the city where
	  it was born, but within a new context: the shopping bag. One of Sal Paradise's
	  thoughts (Kerouac's protagonist and <em>other</em> voice)
	while traveling in San Francisco is manipulated by the construction of the
	  shopping bag. On the outside of the bag, half of the message, "I sat there
	  with these two madmen" places words in the hands of the consumer, as if labeled
	  by Kerouac, himself. On the inside of the bag, the message incriminates the
	  consumer, "Nothing happened." This text could be translated to, "I bought
	  something new...nothing happened;" and
	act as a challenge to beliefs and attitudes common to consumer culture.</font></font></p>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Following the tradition of the Situationists International, a spectacle is
	  made of the viewing public by the transformation of the meaning of everyday
	  materials. The bags are used in the act of what Guy Debord would call a
	    <em>detournment</em>. This interventionist project is most effective outside of the
	  gallery walls, as the bags are distributed to unassuming consumers--literally
	  translating the unknowing consumer into an art collector. The bags benefit
	  from the traditionally passive role of the consumer while luring onlookers
	  to a text that both celebrates Kerouac's work and indicts anyone seated within
	  close proximity. It is the familiarity with the visual language of the shopping
	  bags that enables the consumption of the subversive message.
