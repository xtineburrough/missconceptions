	<p>This is a prototype of a project that shows its functionality. Imagine that the green LED pin light is a strand of white LED lights installed behind the frame of the shadow box, illuminating the text that is hard to read in the cut-out stencil at the forefront of the box; and the wires are soldered in place, the arduino is neatly secured to the back of the frame. Finally, imagine there is one wire connecting the hand to the box. This project does require power.
	<br /><br />
	The image that I submitted was rushed and does not represent the project as well as a photograph of the final, wall-mounted piece will. I should have access to my digital fabrication laboratory in the next week to finish this piece (specifically, I am waiting on a soldering station with proper ventilationâ€”it is too hot in Dallas to solder in my garage right now). I will update this page with a new video and images of the final work.
	<br /><br />
	The coated-hand would be placed near the box on the wall. It is the call for interaction, engaging the viewer to metaphorically and literally close the circuit by bringing humanitity to the voices of digital workers.
