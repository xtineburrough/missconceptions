		<p><em>Wordle Lighghgt</em> is an homage to Aram Saroyan’s 1960s one-word minimalist poem. A modified screenshot of my February First (2022) Wordle game is a contemporary redesign of Saroyan’s National Endowment for the Arts-funded one-word (seven-lettered) poem, “Lighght.” Bringing the two works of conceptual art into economic dialog, Wordle Lighght is my first minted NFT. “Lighght” depicted as a Wordle-inspired digital art collectable will be available for double-the-price of Saroyan's original $750 NEA award. When it is purchased, half of the funds will be awarded to the poet.
