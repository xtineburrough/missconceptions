				<em>Hind Sight is 20/20: Tarot Cards for Working Women in a Global Pandemic</em> is a collaboration between xtine burrough and Allison Jauregi.
This complete deck of tarot cards was made on copper for its natural antimicrobial qualities.

			<p>The cards take two forms. The playing cards (approximately 3.75 by 5.75 inches) feature Allison's illustrations in black matte vinyl on copper sheets with trimmed corners. </p><br />
				<p>burrough also fabricated a series of the twelve major arcana in etchings on large (16 by 24 inch) mirrored-copper plates. These etchings were made via a technique that combines laser etching with sandblasting and polishing.</p></div>

			Allison originally proposed an early version of this project as her undergraduate capstone thesis with burrough as her supervisor. While investigating the question of touch and contagion, the duo took advice from Dale MacDonald who said: "copper." The rest, as they say, is history.
