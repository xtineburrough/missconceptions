<p>Longer Bio (382 words)</p>

<p>xtine burrough is a hybrid artist. She engages participatory audiences at the intersection of media art, remix, and digital poetry. Her creative practice rests on the communicative power of art-making as a vehicle for exploring the boundaries between humans and the technologies they create, embody, and employ. Her practice is iterative; it is conceptual and poetic. She collaborates within and outside the university with diverse populations from students to virtual factory workers in projects that yield multiple layers for various forms of participation in the creation of poetic moments of collaborative meaning-making. Strategically, she archives her work and process, and articulates the relationships between what she makes and does with how she thinks about technology and culture in articles, chapters, and books. burrough uses remix and appropriation as strategies for activism and speaking back to structures of power; and she has edited volumes and portfolio sections for other artists to write, reflect on, expose, and archive their practices.</p>

<p>xtine received a commission as part of "Data/Set/Match" at the Photographersâ€™ Gallery, London (2020); a microgrant from the Nasher Sculpture Center (2019); and grant funding from the Puffin Foundation (2018), Humanities Texas (2017), and California Humanities (2015). She received a Terminal Net Art Award (2011), a UK Big Lottery commission developed by Cornerhouse for the Abandon Normal Devices and Looping the Loop Festivals (2010); and she is a 13th Annual (2009) Webby Award Honoree in the Weird category. Her 2005 project, Delocator.net was positively reviewed in a wide range of media outlets including newspapers, radio, television, and film.</p> 

<p>As an author, x has written, edited, and co-edited several books including <em>Art as Social Practice: Technologies for Change</em> (burrough and Walgren, 2022), <em>The Routledge Handbook to Digital Humanities and Remix Studies</em> (Navas, Gallagher, burrough, 2020), <em>Keywords in Remix Studies</em> (Navas, Gallagher, burrough, 2018), <em>The Routledge Companion to Remix Studies</em> (Navas, Gallagher, burrough, 2014), <em>Foundations of Digital Art and Design with Adobe Creative Cloud</em> (burrough, 2013 and second edition in 2019) and <em>Net Works: Case Studies in Web Art and Design</em> (burrough, 2011).
