		<h1>Biography</h1>
		<p>Long Version:</p>
	<p> xtine burrough&#8217;s hybrid creative/scholarly investigation of emerging technologies uses remix as a strategy
for engaging networked audiences in critical participation. burrough is drawn to remix for the ways in which it signals
appropriation, juxtaposition, and computation—like her own practice in which she often plays at the intersection of tactical media and digital poetry, remix is a hybrid phenomena.</p>

<p>Using social platforms, databases, search engines, blogs, and applications in combination with popular sites like Facebook, YouTube, or Mechanical Turk, burrough creates web communities promoting interpretation and autonomy. burrough is passionate about using digital tools to translate common experiences into personal arenas for discovery. Emergent themes in her work include culture jamming, appropriation, and translation.</p>

<p>As an author, burrough has written, edited, and co-edited several books including <em>Keywords in Remix Studies</em> (2018), <em>The Routledge Companion to Remix Studies</em> (2014), <em>Foundations of Digital Art and Design with Adobe Creative Cloud</em> (2013) and <em>Net Works: Case Studies in Web Art and Design</em> (2011). She is the editor of the <em>Visual Communication Quarterly</em> (January 2015- December 2018).</p>

<p>burrough is a recipient of a Humanities Texas Award and a Puffin Foundation West, Ltd. Award (2016-2017 with Dr. Sabrina Starnaman). She received a California Humanities Award (2015-16 with Dr. Dan Sutko); a Terminal Net Art Award (2011), a UK Big Lottery commission developed by Cornerhouse for the Abandon Normal Devices and Looping the Loop Festivals (2010); and she is a 13th Annual (2009) Webby Award Honoree in the Weird category. Her 2005 project, Delocator.net was positively reviewed in a wide range of media outlets including newspapers, radio, television, and film. burrough has participated in international festivals promoting digital art and culture including Abandon Normal Devices (Manchester, UK), Designs on E-Learning (Helsinki), Electrofringe (AU), Futuresonic (UK), iDMAa, ISEA (Hong Kong 2016, Albuquerque 2012, and Belfast 2009), Prog:ME (BR), Sonar (SP), and xCoAx (Madrid, SP).</p>

<p>Recent projects include <em>Return to Sender, The Laboring Self, The Radium Girls: A Radically Advancing Tour of Exit Signs, The Women of El Toro, A Vigil For Some Bodies, </em>and multiple iterations of the <em>Mechanical Olympics.</em> Her website is missconceptions.net.</p>

<p>xtine is an associate professor in the School of Arts, Technology, and Emerging Communication at The University of Texas at Dallas, where she co-directs two lab spaces, LabSynthE with Dr. Frank Dufour, and SPACE Media Lab with Dr. Banner and Dr. Knight.</p>
		
<p>burrough&#8217;s creative practice rests on the understanding that the world is radically complex and values the communicative power of art-making as a vehicle for exploring the boundaries between humans and the technologies they create, embody, and employ. Her practice is iterative; it is conceptual and poetic. She collaborates within and outside the university with diverse populations from students to virtual factory workers in projects that yield multiple layers for various forms of participation in the creation of poetic moments of tactical media. Strategically, she archives her work and process, and articulates the relationships between what she makes and does with how she thinks about technology and culture in articles, chapters, and books. burrough uses remix and appropriation as strategies for activism and speaking back to structures of power; and she has edited volumes and portfolio sections for other artists to write, reflect on, expose, and archive their practices.</p>

		<p> LabSynthE Bio</p>
		<p>
			LabSynthE is a creative laboratory in the School of Arts, Technology, and Emerging Communication at The University of Texas at Dallas. We investigate synthetic and electronic poetic transactions in participatory sound installations. LabSynthE has exhibited at the Dallas Museum of Art, Plano ArtFest, Ammerman Center 16th Biennial of Art & Technology (Connecticut), and xCoAx gallery exhibition at C ARTEC in Madrid, Spain. We are currently working on projects at the intersection of memory, translation, and poetry. The laboratory is a place where all voices are welcome—we operate like an improvisation group, prioritizing “yes and” as a condition for exchange. LabSynthE is co-organized by participatory artist xtine burrough and sound artist Frank Dufour.
