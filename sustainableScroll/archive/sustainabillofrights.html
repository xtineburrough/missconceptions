"everything gets eaten" by Eirian Friedkin is a reflection on the
feeling of futility, apathy, and decay.

A triptych is a piece of work in three parts where the middle section
is the most important. On of the shortest constructions for sentences
in the English language to express connections requires the triad of
components: a subject, a verb, and an object. When considering the
entanglements in the world it becomes obvious that the subject of one
concept or concern can be(come) the objects of others.

The verb "to eat" refers foremost to taking in food through the mouth,
but the verb can also refer to any (gradual) form of consumption or
destruction. When looking at the world one might feel as if everything
is connected to everything else, but also may play out at the expense
of everything. A handful of popular nouns where chosen at random and
are combined as such to allow the viewer to draw (unexpected)
connections between different concepts and how one may very well
degrade another. At some point this poem is going to have stated every
possible connection between every concept chosen. Every connection
stated is at first one of empowerment since the subject can draw from
the object. The object in turn (is going to become the subject and)
will pass on the exploitation. Everything will feed of something and
is going the be reused. Even if you hold something dear, it can not
escape this cycle.
